        <p>
         I specialize in the intersection of technology, creativity, and education, bringing over 18 years of experience in learning and research consultancy, interactive technology development, and educational leadership.</p>
<p>My career began in academia, but I now lead innovative products, teams, and services in the software industry, working with global leaders such as Arm, Unity, and Amazon. I have spoken at industry events, such as Pulse Europe, on topics around Customer Education and Enablement in the SaaS sector. </p>
<p>In my spare time, I'm a long distance runner and continue to dabble in music technology for fun. I'm an England Athletics Level 3 Coach in Running Fitness, and love supporting and coaching other runners through injury towards endurance events.</p>

<p>As a freelance consultant and developer, I have successfully delivered projects for diverse organizations, including Volvo, Barclays Wealth, The National Library of Scotland, and Smirnoff. My expertise spans customer education leadership, designing bio-engineering systems for research, managing undergraduate programs, and advising bodies and institutions across the Higher Education and Cultural Heritage sectors.
</p><p>
I hold a doctorate in Brain-Computer Music Interfacing from the Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research at the University of Plymouth, UK, where I explored cutting-edge neurotechnology.
</p><p>
In addition to my professional work, I am an active reviewer for the BCI Journal, the Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research Conference, and the Leonardo Music Journal, which recognized me as an outstanding peer reviewer in 2020. I also had the privilege of chairing the 1st International Workshop on Brain-Computer Music Interfacing and the CMMR 2015.
