My work spans across technology, creativity, and education. I have over [over 18 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-eaton-uk/) in learning and research consultancy, interactive technology development, and educational leadership.

My career began in academia, but I now lead products, teams, and services in the software industry, working with global leaders such as [Arm](http://arm.com), [Unity](https://unity.com), and [Amazon](http://amazon.com). I have spoken at industry events, such as Pulse Europe, on topics around Customer Education and Enablement in the SaaS sector.

In my spare time, I'm a long distance runner and continue to dabble in music technology for fun. I'm an England Athletics Level 3 Coach in Running Fitness, and love supporting and coaching other runners through injury towards endurance events.

As a freelance consultant and developer, I have successfully delivered projects for diverse organizations, including Volvo, Barclays Wealth, The National Library of Scotland, and Smirnoff. My expertise spans customer education leadership, designing bio-engineering systems for research, managing undergraduate programs, and advising bodies and institutions across the Higher Education and Cultural Heritage sectors.

I hold a doctorate in Brain-Computer Music Interfacing from the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research](http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/) at the University of Plymouth, UK, where I explored cutting-edge neurotechnology.

In addition to my professional work, I am an active reviewer for the [BCI Journal](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tbci20), the [Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research Conference](https://link.springer.com/conference/cmmr), and the [Leonardo Music Journal](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/lmj), which recognized me as an [outstanding peer reviewer in 2020](https://www.leonardo.info/blog/2020/04/09/recognition-of-leonardos-outstanding-peer-reviewers). I also had the privilege of chairing the [1st International Workshop on Brain-Computer Music Interfacing](https://www.leonardo.info/blog/2020/04/09/recognition-of-leonardos-outstanding-peer-reviewers) and the [CMMR 2015](http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/cmmr2015/).
