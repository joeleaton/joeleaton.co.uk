# Starting Fresh

Welcome to my new digital home. After years of scattered content across different platforms, I've built this site as a single place to share my work across brain-computer interfaces, running coaching, music technology, and education.

## Why Start Again?

I wrote my first website in HTML/CSS  (and a tiny bit of javascript I had to get someone to help me with) way back in 2011 after wanting to turn my Tumblr Blog into more of a portfolio of the things I was doing.  A couple of years later I moved to a Wordpress site which worked well for my BCMI projects at the time. My previous website served its purpose, but it didn't reflect the breadth of what I do and hadn't been updated in years. Research papers sat next to running tips next to workshop announcements, without any real structure or coherence. I didn't even bother adding new projects to it for years.

This new site is designed from the ground up to embrace the multi-faceted nature of my work, with clear sections for each domain while also highlighting the connections between them.

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing:

- **Thoughts and practices on technical education** and how we help people learn complex things
- **Project deep-dives** into BCMI research and performances
- **Running insights** from coaching  athletes
- **Technical tutorials** on Pure Data and music technology

More to come !
