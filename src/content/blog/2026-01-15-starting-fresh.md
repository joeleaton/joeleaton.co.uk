# Starting Fresh

Welcome to my new digital home. After years of scattered content across different platforms, I've built this site as a single place to share my work across brain-computer interfaces, running coaching, music technology, and education.

## Why Start Again?

My previous website served its purpose, but it didn't reflect the breadth of what I do. Research papers sat next to running tips next to workshop announcements, without any real structure or coherence.

This new site is designed from the ground up to embrace the multi-disciplinary nature of my work, with clear sections for each domain while also highlighting the connections between them.

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing:

- **Project deep-dives** into BCMI research and performances
- **Running insights** from coaching  athletes
- **Technical tutorials** on Pure Data and music technology
- **Thoughts on education** and how we help people learn complex things

More to come soon.
