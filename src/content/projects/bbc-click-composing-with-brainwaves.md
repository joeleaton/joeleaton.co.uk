BBC presenter and musician L.J Rich came to visit the ICCMR Lab to explore the technology I was developing for composing music with brainwaves that was being showcased at the upcoming Peninsula Arts Music Festival.

For the feature, L.J played with the BCMI system, learning the nuances and techniques needed to play the music using her brain.

The feature was produced for the BBC Click programme and was showcased in a follow-on [BBC news article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26081451).
