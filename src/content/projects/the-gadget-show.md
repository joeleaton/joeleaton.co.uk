In an episode looking at the future of technology, The Gadget show producers asked "what types of control could be used for wearables in the future?"

They contacted me about showcasing my work, and my colleague Duncan and I travelled to their studio to showcase our Affective Jukebox - a BCMI system that used emotional responses, recorded across the brain's frontal cortex, to select music based on emotion detection.

Imagine if your next track on Spotify was chosen based on how you were feeling?
