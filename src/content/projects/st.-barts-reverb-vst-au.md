# St. Barts Reverb

St. Bartholomew's is a neo-gothic church in Brighton (UK), and is widely considered to be the tallest parish church in Britian with potentially the largest volume due to it's non-standard shape - it's huge!

Years ago I recorded the reverberant characteristics of the space and used it in my undergraduate teaching.

More recently, I've turned it into a Plug-In (Standalone, VST3, AU). Read about the story behind it and how I created it [in this blog post](../../blog/balloons-bikes-brighton-st-barts-reverb).

Take a listen here, download it, and use it in your own music - it's free!

## Audio demos

Here are some examples of St Barts reverb applied to some recordings (no other processing took place):
