# St. Barts Reverb

St. Bartholomew's is a neo-gothic church in Brighton (UK), and is widely considered to be the tallest church in Britian with potentially the largest volume due to it's non-standard shape - it's huge!

## Capturing a space's character

When I lived in Brighton I was fascinated with the acoustics character of the building, and way back when I was teaching I took a group of undergraduate students there one afternoon, with the permission of the priest in an attempt to capture the sound of the place.

Armed with a bag of balloons, some pins, a pair of stereo microphones and a laptop, the students took it in turns to record IR's, or impulse responses (balloons popping); a method of recording how a space reacts to a wide of frequencies over time from a single initiation. A popped balloon is a great way to stimulate the response of a room (it's echo) across the frequency range from a single point in time.

Aside from eliciting some rather odd looks from worshippers (the priest insisted the church stayed open for silent prayers), banging balloons and recording the result is a great way to capture the sonic fingerprint of an environment and when the recorded response is inverted using a process called convolution, you can play music through the reverb - emulating the effect of it being played in the church. This was a great activity to do with creatively and sonically curious students, and they were fascinated back in the studio when we listened back to  their own music with the reverb applied. Instant goth-church!

## The unwanted passerby

Only recently, I stumbled across one of the recordings from St. Barts on an old hard drive and fired it up for a listen. It must have been an outtake or one from an unfortunate student group's recording as although the initial pop of the balloon can be heard echoing around the giant space, the decaying sound is marred by a passing car or motorbike.

What's worse is the doppler effect of the car/bike interference as it passes as it pervades across a wide range of frequencies of the tail
