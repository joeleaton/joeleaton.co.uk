## The ParaMusical Ensemble

The Paramusical Ensemble is comprised of four patients at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability, London to bring new methods of music collaboration to people with paralysis and locked-in syndrome.

In 2017 I built a bespoke version of the system for a short documentary aired on Sky Atlantic.
