# A Stark Mind

A groundbreaking audiovisual performance where the graphic score is controlled entirely by brainwaves. Musicians respond to visual cues generated in real-time by brain activity patterns.

## Technical Approach

The system uses SSVEP (Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials) to detect brain responses to flickering visual stimuli. This data controls MaxScore, generating musical notation in real-time that performers sight-read during the performance.

## Key Innovation

Rather than using brain data to directly produce sound, this project positions the brain as a composer — generating scores that human musicians interpret. This creates a unique feedback loop between neurotechnology and musical expression.
