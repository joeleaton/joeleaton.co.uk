# A Stark Mind

A groundbreaking audiovisual performance where the graphic score is controlled entirely by brainwaves. Musicians respond to visual cues generated in real-time by brain activity patterns.

## Technical Approach

A Stark Mind uses a brain-computer music interface (BCMI) to conduct a visual score that is projected on screen for the musicians to follow. The hyrbid-BCMI performer uses a combination of three brainwave control methods to direct and arrange the graphical score, controlling the musicians. The abstract score acts as visual cues to the musicians directing their playing styles and interaction with each other throughout the performance. The hybrid-BCMI uses visual gazing for SSVEP control, simultaneous two way motor imagery control and emotion detection to generate and control the score.

## Key Innovation

Rather than using brain data to directly produce sound, this project positions the brain as a composer, generating moving scores of abstract shapes that human musicians interpret. 
This creates a unique feedback loop between neurotechnology and musical expression.
