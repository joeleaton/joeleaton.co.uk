# The Warren

The Warren is the the first piece of music I composed for brainwave control. It uses the SSVEP eye gazing technique but was pretty bulky to transport for performances as it required a desktop computer with two monitors, a laptop PC and a lot of EEG hardware.

The music was inspired both by nature recordings I was making at the time, whilst I was living in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, as well as early electroacoustic pieces I was discovering, such as _Valley Flow_ by Dennis Smalley, and the recordings of Chris Watson.

The system comprised a big powerful desktop computer with a crazy-spec GPU for ensuring the visual stimuli stayed clocked (to ensure strong SSVEP responses), a big electrode amplifier for the brain cap, and a laptop running the musical system via MID, with the screen providing some feedback on the musical arrangement and what was being triggered. I have a distinct memory of the computer power bank dying on me on the day before a performance in Plymouth! Thankfully it wasn't too bad a fix. 

The move towards a more portable, cheaper and accessible system formed the basis for the next piece I made after The Warren, Flex.

## Performances

The piece was first performed at the Arnolfini in Bristol in 2011, then at the Peninsula Arts Festival in 2012.
