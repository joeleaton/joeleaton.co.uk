# The Warren

The Warren is the the first piece of music I composed for brainwave control. It uses the SSVEP eye gazing technique but was pretty bulky to transport for performances. 

The video shows me gazing at 4 stimuli flashing at different frequencies. You can see them grow in size depending on the strength and length of my gaze. The icons are connected to different musical events as I _play_ my way through the piece.

The music was inspired both by nature recordings I was making at the time, whilst I was living in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, as well as early electroacoustic pieces I was discovering, such as _Valley Flow_ by Dennis Smalley, and the recordings of Chris Watson.

The system needed a crazy-spec GPU for ensuring the visual stimuli stayed clocked (to ensure strong SSVEP responses), a big electrode amplifier for the brain cap, and a laptop running the musical system via MID, with the screen providing some feedback on the musical arrangement and what was being triggered. I have a distinct memory of the computer power bank dying on me on the day before a performance in Plymouth! Thankfully it wasn't too bad a fix.

The move towards a more portable, cheaper and accessible system formed the basis for the next piece I made after The Warren, Flex.

## Performances

The piece was first performed at the Arnolfini in Bristol in 2011, then at the Peninsula Arts Festival in 2012.
