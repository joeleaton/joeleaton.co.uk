# The Space Between Us

A collaborative brain-computer music performance that explores the concept of shared neural states between two performers. Using dual EEG systems, the piece maps the similarities and differences in brain activity to musical parameters.

## Concept

When two people share an experience, their brain activity can synchronise in measurable ways. This project asks: what does that synchronisation sound like? And what happens musically when two minds drift apart?

## Technical Implementation

Two performers wear EEG headsets simultaneously. A custom Pure Data patch receives both data streams via OSC, computing real-time measures of inter-brain synchrony. These measures control harmonic, timbral, and rhythmic elements of the musical output.

## Impact

This work contributed to the growing field of multi-brain BCIs and demonstrated new possibilities for collaborative human-computer performance.
