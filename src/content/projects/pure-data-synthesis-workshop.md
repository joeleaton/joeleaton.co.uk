# Elysium

Elysium is a software synthesizer where you can build and evolve textured harmonic layers of drone-based bliss from scratch.

Using additive synthesis, construct chords of sine waves, control movement, add layers, apply distortion and reverb, sit back and bliss-out.

## Technical Implementation

Elysium is built using the free/open source [plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) environment for the Pure Data visual programming language.

To run Elysium, you need to download and install [plugdata](https://plugdata.org/). Plugdata runs as standalone app or , or as a VST3, LV2, CLAP or AU plugin, meaning you can run Elysium in a DAW as a plugin to record and edit it's sounds.

(One day  I'd like to compile it as a standalone plugin but time, life, and UI build for all those controls...)

## Download

[Download Elysium ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oEUDJAa42QjhsWTCELIa487aWOojcaLD/view?usp=sharing)(it's free!) 

**Requirements:** plugdata (Win, macOS, Linux).

**Outstanding Tech Tasks in v1: **Add DAW parameter controls for automation.
