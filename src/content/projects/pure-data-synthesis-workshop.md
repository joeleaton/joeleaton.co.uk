# Elysium

Elysium is a software synthesiser based on additive synthesis that allows you to build textured harmonic layers of drone-based bliss from scratch.

Build chords of sine waves, control movement, add layers, apply distortion and reverb, sit back and bliss-out.

## Technical Implementation

Elysium is built using the free/open source [Plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) environment for the Pure Data visual programming language. 

To run Elysium, you need to download and install [Plugdata](https://plugdata.org/). Plugdata runs as standalone app or , or as a VST3, LV2, CLAP or AU plugin, meaning you can run Elysium in a DAW as a plugin to record and edit it's sounds.
