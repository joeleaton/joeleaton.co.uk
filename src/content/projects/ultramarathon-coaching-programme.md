As [a running coach](https://joeleaton.co.uk/running-coaching/), I often emphasise the benefits of strength training and how it can elevate your performance. This article brings together much of the advice I give to long-distance runners, offering guidance and exercises to seamlessly integrate strength training into your routine.

## 1. Introduction

The benefits of strength training for long-distance runners are well-documented [1]. Yet, many runners, myself included, can be guilty of neglecting it. We always have a list of excuses: our running is going too well to need it, it’s hard to find time, we lack access to a gym, we don’t know what to do, and let’s face it, sometimes it's pretty boring!

That’s why I’ve created this article, to provide clear guidance and exercises tailored for runners. The goal is to make strength training accessible and straightforward, ensuring it doesn’t become a daunting or dull task. This guide is for every runner, regardless of speed and fitness level, and you can do 90% of these exercises without needing a gym or special equipment.

You can use a rucksack filled with books instead of weights, a towel on a slippery floor instead of an ab wheel, and the stairs in your house for calf-raises and drops. If you have access to a gym, these exercises will help build a strong foundation.

This is not a comprehensive guide to strength training but an accessible starting point to help you get going, explore new avenues, and add some structure to your routine in an often ambiguous field.

## 2. Benefits of strength training to runners

Runners are most vulnerable to injury when fatigued—whether from lack of rest, overtraining, or overexertion during events or workouts [2]. Strength training helps combat muscle fatigue, allowing you to run further and faster before reaching the danger zone where injuries are more likely.

Improving your body’s alignment and impact resistance also helps maintain good running form [3], making your body work more efficiently and conserve energy. This leads to running faster and longer, with improvements in key fitness indicators like VO2 Max [1].

In short, becoming a stronger runner makes you more resilient, improving your performance, faster times, and reducing injury risk.

## 3. Key points to remember

Here are some tips to keep in mind as you incorporate strength training into your running routine:

- **Stretch before each workout**: Stretching is crucial for warming up your muscles and preparing your body.
- **Go slow**: Perform exercises slowly and progress from the foundational to the advanced exercises. Master the basics before moving on.
- **Technique is key**: Focus on perfecting your technique. Use mirrors, film yourself, and seek help from a coach if needed. Only add weights once your form is correct.
- **Everything is interconnected**: Strengthening all areas of the body is essential, as injuries can often stem from weaknesses elsewhere. When you strengthen an injured area, you’re often missing the area of deficiency that caused the injury, which could mean further issues later on.
- **Training is about conditioning**: We train to condition our bodies for the loads they will endure during races and training. This means that your training should be appropriate for your goals, with space for extended seasonal periods of no or minimal training for full body recovery.

## 4. Basics

These two exercises form the foundation for finding your centre of gravity, understanding spinal length, and properly engaging your glutes:

## 5. Exercises 1 – Foundational

These exercises build strength in key muscle groups used in running, particularly the core muscles, glutes, and hamstrings. Perfect your technique with minimal or no weight before increasing reps or weight:
