# Ultramarathon Coaching Programme

A personalised coaching service for ultramarathon and distance runners, providing structured training plans, race strategy, and ongoing support.

## Approach

Every athlete is different. My coaching philosophy centres on understanding each runner's goals, lifestyle, and physiological profile to create training that fits their life — not the other way around.

## What's Included

- **Personalised training plans** adjusted weekly based on feedback and data
- **Race strategy** development for specific events
- **Regular check-ins** to discuss progress, fatigue, and motivation
- **Heart rate and pace zone** calibration

## Athletes

Currently coaching 10 athletes across distances from marathon to 100-mile ultramarathons, with a focus on sustainable progression and injury prevention.
