Balance is an iOS app for monitoring your balance through music and sound. The app was designed as a prototype system for improving balance for those with diminishing motor functions using audio feedback. The  device responds in real-time to your movement and helps track your balance as you try and hold a specific muscular position.

The video demonstrates one example of how Balance can be used. Stand up, arm out stretched and balance a mobile device on your hand for a long period of time. 

Balance provides adaptive feedback as you fall under the strain. Move and the sound moves with you, drop your arms and you lose the sonic balance.
